1:COLLECTOR:Have 10 cards at @a time.
2:DICTATOR:Defeated by Fog @5 times.:You have been defeated by the Fog and @exiled from the forest. You failed your @responsibility as the protector of the @forest and left the Fog to dictate @the forest.

20:WARRIOR:Fall into the @river five times.
21:YOURSELF:Use 20 cards.
