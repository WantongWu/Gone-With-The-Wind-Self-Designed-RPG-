# Overall Instruction
The main goal for the player is to find out the truth (what is going on in the forest) and successfully solve the problem. To achieve this goal, one principle is to collect items in the forest (including coins, potions and keys). The player can move with WASD on the keyboard, and get into rooms by facing the door and using keys (press Q to open the inventory and choose with WASD on keyboard) to open the door. There are two kinds of potions: red and blue, both will be in the inventory after the player collects them. Using a red potion can restore 1 heart, and using a blue potion will teleport the player to their house. There will also be a nun near the player’s house that can also help the player to restore their hearts.

To win the game, the player should interact with everything they can interact with in the map and discover the storyline from the conversations with others. To interact with items, the player needs to press E on the keyboard. The player can get cards by talking to animals/people and opening chests. Other key commands include P for in-game pause, Escape (Esc) for option menu, and Enter to proceed/continue dialogue or choose an option. Player can check the key commands in option menu anytime in the game.

# Card System
The card system is one of the most important parts of the game. There are cards that can deal lots of damage, heal and grow your health inside a battle, and/or help you grow your strength. As a result, it is helpful for the player to actively collect the cards from chests and NPCs and use them in battles. They can also buy cards from the fairy on the bridge (at the middle right part of the map). Inside the battle, the player can only use the card on the top of the stack; however, they can also choose to sort the card stack so that the most powerful card will be on the top of the stack.

# Multiple Endings
There are five endings in this game, and the game has mainly 3 phases. In the first phase, the goal is to find and defeat the General. The player can follow the road and go across the river by the bridge, and go west and go across another river again to get to General Aaron’s castle. The player will meet lumbermen (2 in total), soldiers (3 in total), goblins (4 in total) that they can battle with, and finally meet the General. If the player was defeated by the General 3 times, there will be an ending: Shame, that the player has to start playing from the beginning again.

After successfully defeating the General, the player has two choices: believe or not that there is a “monster”, which is the fog in the forest. If the player chose not to believe, they will go to Bad Ending (BE): Undercurrent, that they didn’t find out all the truth and the problems in the forest are still waiting to be solved.

If the player chose to believe, they will go to phase 2, and the goal would be finding, talking to and defeating the fog. The fog is at the lower right corner of the map. If the player was defeated by the fog 5 times, there will be an ending: Dictator, and the player has to start playing from the beginning again.

There will be two cases after the player defeats the fog, both need the player to talk to the General again after the battle with fog.

If the strength of the player is larger than 30, the fog will die and the player will go to Normal Ending (NE): Martyr, where you are now in a disadvantageous position in the negotiation with human beings without fog. If the strength of the player is smaller than 30 and wins the fog, the player will go to True Ending (TE): Protector. 

There are also two endings that the player needs to start again: if the player falls into the river, they will Drown and the game will end. If the player dies (loose all 5 hearts with the assistance of the Nun and red potion), there will be a Game Over. 

After the game is over, the player can choose to either restart the whole game or reload previous saved progress. To save the progress, they need to take any portal on the map or interact with the bed in their house.
